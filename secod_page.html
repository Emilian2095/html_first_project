      All the house animals are domesticated by <a href="third_page.html">humans</a>. The first
      animal to be domesticated by humans was the <a href="forth_page.html">dog</a>, as a
      commensal, at least 15,000 years ago. Other animals, including goats,
      sheep, and cows, were domesticated starting around 11,000 years ago. Among
      birds, the chicken was first domesticated in East Asia, seemingly for
      cockfighting, some 7,000 years ago. The horse came under domestication
      around 5,500 years ago in central Asia as a working animal. Among
      invertebrates, the silkworm and the western honey bee were domesticated
      over 5,000 years ago for silk and honey, respectively.And later on
