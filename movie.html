    <h2>Main Story</h2>
    <p>
      In 2018, after Wade Wilson uses Cable's time-travel device to prevent the
      death of his girlfriend Vanessa,[a] he travels from his universe,
      Earth-10005,[b] to Earth-616 on the "Sacred Timeline",[c] hoping to join
      the Avengers and give his life added meaning. He is rejected by Happy
      Hogan and returns to his universe. Six years later, Wade has broken up
      with Vanessa, retired from being the masked mercenary Deadpool, and works
      as a used-car salesman with his friend and former X-Force member, Peter.
      During Wade's birthday party, the Time Variance Authority captures him and
      brings him to Paradox, who explains that they are an organization outside
      of time that monitors the Sacred Timeline and wider multiverse, and offers
      him an important role on Earth-616. Wade initially accepts, however
      Paradox then reveals that Wade's timeline is deteriorating as a result of
      the death of its stabilizing "anchor being", Logan, while protecting his
      daughter Laura.[d] Paradox plans to use a "Time Ripper" device to
      accelerate this process, so Wade steals his TemPad and uses it to travel
      to Logan's grave, hoping to resurrect him and save their timeline. When
      this fails, Wade travels the multiverse searching for a replacement
      alternate universe "variant" of Logan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Logan and Wade meet a Deadpool variant called "Nicepool" who directs them
      towards a resistance group that have been fighting Cassandra. On the way,
      Logan realizes that Wade is bluffing about the TVA being able to fix his
      timeline, and the pair fight until both are left unconscious. They are
      found by the resistance group, consisting of Laura, Elektra, Blade, and
      Gambit. Wade proposes an alliance to fight Cassandra, and Laura convinces
      Logan, distraught over his reluctance that led to the death of his fellow
      X-Men, to join the cause. The resistance members distract Cassandra's
      henchmen while Wade and Logan block her powers by placing Juggernaut's
      helmet on her head. Cassandra is betrayed by her follower Pyro on behalf
      of Paradox, and almost dies until Logan convinces Wade to remove the
      helmet. Cassandra heals herself and opens a portal to Earth-10005, which
      Logan and Wade jump through.
    </p>
    <h2>Ending</h2>

    <p>
      Cassandra learns about Paradox's plan from Pyro, kills him, and follows
      Logan and Wade to Earth-10005. She learns about the Time Ripper's
      completion and how to use it from Paradox's mind and plans to destroy all
      timelines, leaving only the Void. Cassandra summons an army of Deadpool
      variants, who kill "Nicepool" and battle Wade and Logan until Peter
      arrives and distracts them. Paradox tells Wade and Logan that one of them
      could destroy the Time Ripper by disrupting its power flow, but this would
      kill them, even with their powers. Both Wade and Logan destroy the Time
      Ripper together, killing Cassandra in the process, and are able to survive
      by sharing the burden. Paradox is arrested by the TVA's Hunter B-15, who
      congratulates Wade and Logan and says their actions have stopped
      Earth-10005 from deteriorating. Wade asks Hunter B-15 to save the
      resistance group from the Void and change the history of Logan's world.
      She explains that the latter is not possible because Logan's history is
      what led to him being a hero now, and allows Logan to stay in Wade's
      world. Wade invites Logan to meet his friends, and with encouragement from
      Logan, reconciles with Vanessa.
